      My passion as a software engineer is to create innovative solutions
      to complex problems and develop cutting-edge technology that can
      make a positive impact in the world. I strive to be a leader in
      the software engineering field, and I'm constantly looking for
      ways to use my technical knowledge and experience to create solutions
      that make life better for everyone. I'm driven by the challenge of
      creating solutions that are efficient and effective, and I'm
      passionate about building something that can change the world.

      Having been a self-taught software engineer as a hobby over
      the past few years, in 2021 I stepped away from a 10 year
      career as a Team Leader at Trader Joes to attend Hack Reactor`s
      Software Engineering Immersive.
